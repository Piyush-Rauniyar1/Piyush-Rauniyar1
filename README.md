## About me
I'm a student focused on backend development, system design, and AI/ML. I enjoy learning how distributed systems are built and how models (classical ML and generative models) can be integrated into services and products.

- Role: Student  
- Focus: Backend engineering, system design, machine learning, and generative AI  
- Current: Coursework, hands-on experiments, and architecture study  
- Open to: mentorship, study-collabs, code reviews, and small contributions

---

## What I'm learning
- System design: scalability, load balancing, caching, consistency, partitioning, observability  
- Backend: REST/GraphQL APIs, microservices, authentication, message queues, background jobs  
- Databases: Postgres, MongoDB, indexing, query tuning, data modeling for ML  
- DevOps / MLOps basics: Docker, CI/CD, model deployment, monitoring, reproducible pipelines  
- Machine learning & Gen AI:
  - ML fundamentals: supervised learning, evaluation, feature engineering  
  - Deep learning basics, transfer learning  
  - Transformers & modern NLP concepts  
  - Generative AI / LLMs: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, safety & evaluation  
  - Tools: PyTorch / TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, LangChain (exploring)

---

## Tech Stack & Tools
- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
- Backend: Node.js, Express, FastAPI  
- ML: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face transformers  
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- DevOps/MLOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, basic cloud deployment  
- Other: Git, REST, gRPC, Celery/RQ (background jobs)

---

## How I work / contribute
- I prefer small, iterative experiments and well-documented repos.  
- I enjoy integrating models into APIs and exploring trade-offs (latency, cost, accuracy).  
- I welcome feedback on architecture and model choices — open to pair debugging and design reviews.  
- If you want my help: open an issue and tag me — I can help with docs, small features, or learning tasks.

---

## Goals (short-term)
- Build and deploy a small Gen-AI service (chat or Q&A) with proper API, tests, and monitoring  
- Complete two backend + ML experiments with Dockerized deployment  
- Study 10 system design topics and create one diagram per topic (caching, sharding, etc.)  
- Contribute a documentation or tests PR to an open-source ML/backend repo
